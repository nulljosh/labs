# Homeward Technical Whitepaper

**v1.0** | August 2026

Homeward is a Craigslist-style board for lost and found pets: post an animal,
find one, mark it resolved. Web plus a native iOS app on a shared Supabase
backend. Live at [pets.heyitsmejosh.com](https://pets.heyitsmejosh.com).

## Problem

Lost-pet posts live on Facebook groups and Craigslist, both of which are
account-walled and neither of which is searchable by location or species. The
constraint that shapes everything here: a person who just lost a dog will not
create an account. Any signup step loses the post.

## No-Auth Posting

There are no accounts. Posting writes a listing and returns a private
edit-token link — the same mechanic Craigslist uses. Whoever holds the link can
edit or resolve the listing; nobody else can, because the token is the
credential.

Mutation runs through a Postgres RPC (`update_listing`) rather than a direct
table write, so the token check happens server-side inside the function. A
client that guesses a listing id still cannot mutate it without the token, and
RLS denies unmediated writes to the table outright.

Resolved listings are marked, not deleted — a found pet is the useful half of
the record.

## Data Model

One `listings` table (species, status, location, contact, photo, edit token)
plus a `pet-photos` storage bucket. No joins, no user table, nothing to
migrate. Photos upload straight to Supabase Storage from the client.

## Clients

| Platform | Stack | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Web | Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind, on Vercel | Static export |
| iOS | SwiftUI, xcodegen, supabase-swift | Same table, same RPC |

Both clients talk to Supabase directly — there is no intermediate API to keep
in sync, which is why the token check has to live in the database.

## Privacy

No accounts means no user records to leak. A listing carries whatever contact
method the poster chose to publish, and nothing else; the edit token is the
only secret and it is held by the poster alone.
