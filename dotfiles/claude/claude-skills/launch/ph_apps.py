  comment="Hi, I'm Josh, I built Atlin. Renting in Vancouver meant a dozen tabs and no sense of whether a price was fair.\n\nSo Atlin does one thing: you type a city, it pulls what is for rent or for sale, and scores each home against the typical price for its size. The best deals sit at the top. It works for any place on earth, with prices in the local currency, square feet or metres per country, and labels in your language.\n\nThere is a web app, an iPhone and Mac app, and a terminal version. Listings come from public sources, so coverage is thinner in some cities than others, and I would like to hear where it misses.\n\nHappy to answer anything.",date='Nov 2'),

  comment="Hi, I'm Josh, I built Cartons. I only ever want one answer about a package: how many days until it shows up.\n\nSo Cartons shows exactly that. Paste a UPS tracking number, or the whole link from a shipping email, and it reads the status from UPS and puts a countdown next to the package. It also shows the last scan, the service and where it is headed, and it sends a notification when a package moves.\n\nThere is no account and no server. Your list stays on your phone and syncs through iCloud. It reads UPS only for now. The web app is free to try, and the iPhone, iPad and Mac app is $0.99 once.\n\nHappy to answer anything.",date='Nov 3'),

  comment="Hi, I'm Josh, I built Hermes. App Store Connect is a website built for one app at a time, and I ship a lot of apps.\n\nHermes is a Mac app built for all of them at once: every app in one list with its icon, its live version on each platform and where it stands in review. Open one for versions, metadata, screenshots, builds, TestFlight, reviews, submissions, prices and purchases. Every change shows the exact command first and asks before it runs.\n\nIt talks to App Store Connect with your own key, so nothing goes through a server of mine.

  comment="Hi, I'm Josh, I built Hamurapi. In 1968 Doug Dyment wrote Hamurabi, a text game where you rule an old city for ten years. I wanted to see it.\n\nSo every number is on screen as something you can see: houses for people, plots for land, sacks for grain. A good harvest makes the crowd cheer, rats run at the barn, and people you starve leave as ghosts whose graves stay. Between harvests ten small story events happen, each with two choices.\n\nThere is a new game with three levels, the classic 1968 game with nothing added, and a daily game where everyone gets the same luck so you can compare grades. The web game is free. The iPhone and Mac apps are free for the first week after Apple approves them, then $0.99 once.\n\nHappy to answer anything.",date='Nov 5'),

  comment="Hi, I'm Josh, I built Vancouver Vice. Rent is four grand and it rains nine months a year, so I made a game about it.\n\nIt is a third person, GTA-style game set in the real city. The Unreal build streams Google's 3D scan of Vancouver, so you start outside the actual Apple Store on Georgia. You can play as Joshua downtown, Ben in Kits or Alexandre in Victoria and switch any time. Your family gets pulled in along the way.\n\nThe browser version runs on a phone or a computer, and there are builds for Mac, Windows and Linux on GitHub. It is a joke about the city I live in, made with real love for it.\n\nHappy to answer anything.",date='Nov 6'),
