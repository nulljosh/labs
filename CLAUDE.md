# Books Repo

`books.heyitsmejosh.com` — Joshua's book rankings/TBR site. Split out from the `nulljosh.github.io` (echo) repo into its own repo+domain (was previously nested under echo, which made no sense — books and echo are unrelated projects).

## Files
- `index.html` — the live site (uses shared `tokens.css` + `fonts/` copied from the portfolio repo for consistent design)
- `book_rankings.md` — markdown source of the same ranked list (maintained in parallel, not auto-generated from/to index.html — both must be edited together)

## Rule: this is an unread-only (TBR) list
When the user says they've read, finished, or are partway through a book and want it off the list, remove its entry from **both** `book_rankings.md` and `index.html`, then renumber remaining entries sequentially in both files. Don't remove a book just because they mention reading it unless they ask for removal.
